== Gameplay

For this game jam, our goal is to work primarly on the gameplay, developping it and making it fun
and enjoyable. To do that, we decide to sacrifice the game naration and history to have more time
to spend on the gameplay loop, actions and diversity.

You can find all the details about the gameplay in on the decated xref:./gameplay/index.adoc[Gameplay section]
of this documentation.
